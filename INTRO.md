Our service allow people from other PoW blockchains **to "mine" TRX with their GPUs**.

That sounds nice but, how does it work? We currently rely in an automated mining-exchange-transfer process to pay TRX miners, but there is a better and more efficient way to get the TRX for mining payments, by producing blocks ourselves and distributing the rewards to every miner in our pool.

We have this dream, **to switch every PoW miner to TRON**, we want everyone to enjoy all of the advantages that TRON has, and we need your votes for this!
