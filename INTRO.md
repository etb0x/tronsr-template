Our service allow people from PoW blockchains (Ethereum and others) **to mine TRX with their GPUs**.

That sounds nice but, how does it work? We've developed an automated mining and exchanging process, when miners join our pool, they are internally mining Ethereum, we take care of everything to deliver TRX to their addresses, automatically, a seamless way for then to switch from Ethereum (or any other dagger hashimoto coin) to TRON!

We want to simplify things for miners **and be the easiest and most direct way for then to switch to TRON**, and be able to get TRX in real time the same way they would get ETH by mining it!
